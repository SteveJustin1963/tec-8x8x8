# tec-8x8x8

* expand 8x8 into cube
* use special OUT commands to put data 3x bytes on all buses, 
* or expand current 6x led ports by 2 and one latch on address lines

* code in asm and forth 

## Iterate
* put photoresistor in matrix to interact with led out out, induce feedback loops
* superposition code behaviour thru mixing matrix
*
