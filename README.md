# tec-8x8x8

* use all 2x 8 latch ports from LED's and SPK plus plus add 1 extra 8 port latch 
* or use special OUT commands to put data of 3x bytes on data and address buses, address bus will act as data output
* code in asm and forth 

# Iterate
* read photoresistor via schmitt or ADC and input to mixing table to interact with LED output, 
* induce feedback loops and effects
* superposition code behaviour thru mixing matrix
*
