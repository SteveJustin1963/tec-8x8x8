# tec-8x8x8

* expand 8x8 into cube
* use special OUT commands to put data 3x bytes on all buses, or
* or use all 2x 8 latch ports from LED's and SPK and port 6 plus add 1 extra latch 
* code in asm and forth 

## Iterate
* put photoresistor in matrix to interact with led out out, induce feedback loops
* superposition code behaviour thru mixing matrix
*
