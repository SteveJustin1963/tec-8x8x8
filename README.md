# tec-8x8x8

* or use all 2x 8 latch ports from LED's and SPK plus add 1 extra 8 port latch 
* or use special OUT commands to put data 3x bytes on all buses
* code in asm and forth 

## Iterate
* put photoresistor in matrix to interact with led out out, induce feedback loops
* superposition code behaviour thru mixing matrix
*
