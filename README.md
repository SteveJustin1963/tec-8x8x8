# tec-8x8x8

* use all 2x 8 latch ports from LED's and SPK plus plus add 1 extra 8 port latch 
* or use special OUT commands to put data of 3x bytes on data and address buses, address bus will act as data output
* code in asm and forth 

## Iterate
* put photoresistor in matrix to interact with led out out, induce feedback loops
* superposition code behaviour thru mixing matrix
*
